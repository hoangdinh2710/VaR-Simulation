# VaR Simulations

In the financial industry, Value-at-risk (VaR) is a new standard measurement of risk. VaR offers asset managers a better understanding of risk comparing to the simple standard deviation measurement. It tackles the weakness of standard deviations by considering only the downside risk rather than both tails of the distribution. Actual VaR calculation is straight-forward, it is the minimum loss that could occur if an unlikely event happens. However, to effectively manage risk, one should estimate the future VaR rather than using the historical VaR. The three common methods to estimate VaR are Non-Parametric, Parametric (Historical Simulation) and the Monte Carlo Simulation. This research paper introduces a new approach to measure VaR using the replicated portfolio. The replicated portfolio is built using parameters from the regression of the portfolio returns and the performance of 11 equity sectors. The estimated VaRs are then compared to the actual VaR. All four approaches usually yield smaller values than the actual VaR. The parametric and the Monte Carlo Simulation methods yield close estimations. The decomposition method fails to capture all the risks of the actual portfolio; hence, it also fails to deliver a fair estimation. While other methods are only sensitive to the parameters of the distribution (mean and standard deviations), the decomposition method can detect both changes in the shape of the distribution and the parameters.
